# Quick sort algorithm with tests

In this repo, you can find an implementation of the quick-sort algorithm in Ruby. But it has some errors, as you can observe running the test suite by running `rspec quick-sort.spec.rb`.

The objective of this exercise is that you fix those errors and create a PR to master. You should not modify the existing tests, but you can add more if needed.

**You have 2 hours to complete this exercise.** In order to evaluate if you completed it on time, we will use
- starting time: the time that this repo was created
- submission time: the time you create a PR with a success check that all tests are passing

Once you created a PR with passing tests, you are done with this exercise and you should proceed with the second part of the Interview Prep Assessment. No need to merge the PR into master.

Happy fixing!
