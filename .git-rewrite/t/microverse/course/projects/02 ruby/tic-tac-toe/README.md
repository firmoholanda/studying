Microverse version of Tic-Tac-Toe game

## 🔨 instructions

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game where you just need 1 minute to play.

Usage:
- To run the game make sure to give execute permission to the main.rb 
``` 
chmod +x bin/main.rb 
```
- After that you can start the game by running 
``` 
ruby ./bin/main.rb
```

The main rules are the following:

- This just for two players (not one, not three)
- Player #1 type his name, and then player #2 do the same
- The teams are randomly selected (you can be either X or O, who knows!)
- First thing first. Player one begins selecting the position on board (from 1 to 9)
- Player #2 makes his move just the same way
- You just keep filling the board until some player achieves 3 in a row ('XXX' or 'OOO')
- The winner is selected and congratulated
